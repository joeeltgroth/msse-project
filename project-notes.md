### First attempt at networking computers on a subnet via a separate switch and bridging via WiFi
Worked on setting up local network.  Following this: 
https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linking_Subnets_with_Static_Routes
Had a big struggle with this.  Though I was able to setup a 10.0.0.0 network, I wasn't able to get routing (or bridging?) to work.  I tried having my stand-alone 10.0.0.0 network, but tried to make one of the boxes WiFi wireless interfaces into a bridge, but got errors back perhaps indicating that wasn't allowed... not sure why.  Since my project is more about Kubernetes than networking, and the networking I care about is AWS, GCP, Azure, vSphere, etc, not home-style Linksys hardware, I decided to leave that behind... 


### Second attempt at networking using base 192.168.1.0 network on existing home network
Just allocate 192.168.1.x static addresses to the boxes by connecting an unmanaged swith into the main router and get on with the show of installing kubernetes. 


### The resulting network

Have been using this doc to understand how to configure networks on Ubuntu: 
https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/network-configuration


### My process for setting up a Latitude E5540 with Ubuntu linux

First, I downloaded [Ubuntu Server 20.10](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).  I got an .iso file.  
I used commands like these to burn a CVD disk becuase I couldn't get a flash drive to boot on the old hardware I have. 
```bash
hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ubuntu-20.10-live-server-amd64.img ubuntu-20.10-live-server-amd64.iso 
diskutil list
diskutil umount /dev/disk2s1
sudo dd if=./ubuntu-20.10-live-server-amd64.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m
```
The above commands resulted in a bootable DVD. 

The reason I choose Ubuntu Server is that I wanted a lightweight server with no graphical user interface.  I looked into 
Photon OS Minimal, but got stuck and given that I use Ubuntu more often at work it seemed like the logical choice. 

To install Ubuntu, I started the Latitude E5540 and pressed F12 until the boot menu came up, and I choose
CD/DVD as the boot medium. I installed the Ubuntu server fully on the disk (these computers were prior wiped clean with dban.org's boot/nuke product). 

On most of the boxes, I let them come up using DHCP, then later changed their IP address to 
a static. 

I also installed an ssh server on each box. This allows me to connect from my MacBook, the computer
I normally use, and not have to go to the command line on each computer's individual keyboard. 

[Pictures of the installation process](installing-ubuntu.md)


### Setting IP Addresses
A tool called "netplan" is used on Ubuntu Linux (probably other distributions also), to configure 
networking on linux. 

The important file is /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml. (note that the name can vary a bit, but it is the only file in that directory).  Below I am configuring with 
dhcp turned off, and 192.168.1.50 as the address. The gateway is the address of my 
Linksys router/switch. 

Below I am showing the nameservers, but I couldn't configure that section until I'd setup
a bind9 DNS server (which was then listening to DNS queries on 192.168.1.50)
```
network:
  ethernets:
    enp10s0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.50/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        search: [joesmsse.com]
        addresses: [192.168.1.50, 192.168.1.1]
  version: 2
```
Useful Commands when setting the IP:  

`ip a` - show the network interfaces

`sudo lshw -class network` - get detailed network interface details. 

`sudo ethtool eth4` - changes ethernet card settings (auto-negotiation, port speed... ) 

`vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` - edit the netplan configuration to set static ip, gateway, and nameservers. 

`sudo netplan apply` - apply changes to the netplan

`cat /etc/os-release` - what version of Linux you are running


### Installing a DNS Server. 

The instructions I use later for Kubernetes don't require a DNS server, but I wanted to set one up to see how it is done and learn more about how DNS is configured. 

I setup the box I called f6thw as with bind9 as a DNS server while referencing the [Ubuntu DNS documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-domain-name-service-dns)

1. Install bind9: `sudo apt install bind9`
2. Upgrade all the packages (not strictly necessary, but good practice): `sudo apt dist-upgrade -y` (See [How to List Available Updates...](https://www.poftut.com/how-to-list-available-updates-and-updateable-packages-with-apt-apt-get-aptitude-commands/) 
for apt command explanations. 
3. Edit the bind9 configuration file `vi /etc/bind/named.conf.options`. 
5. Restat the bind9 service: `sudo systemctl restart bind9.service`. 
6. dig www.htch.com - note the query time is significantly less after the 1st time. 

When doing a dig, remember to look for the answer section.  For example, in the query below, the question section is just echoing back what I asked for, but the ANSWER section shows the address I want.  If the answer wasn't found, there won't be an answer section. 
```
# dig haproxy.joesmsse.com

```

It was interesting for me to see the named.conf.local file points to two other "db" files: one that
specifies the mapping from name to address, and the other from address to name. 

The bind9 configuration. Key thing here is the zone and reverse zone definition and the path to the files that have the mappings. 
```
joe@f6thw:~$ cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

zone "joesmsse.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.joesmsse.com";
};

zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
  type master;
  file "/etc/bind/db.192";
};
```

The mapping from name to IP. 
I think this is saying it serves everyting in joesmsse.com, and that the nameserver "ns" can be found on 192.168.1.50.  And, I wanted a name "haproxy" (cause this box is also where I plan to install that), so that is set to the same address (CNAME) that ns is.  Pretty sure this is where we'll set all the mappings for all the static k8s cluster boxes in the network. 
```
joe@f6thw:~$ cat /etc/bind/db.joesmsse.com
;
; BIND data file for joesmsse
;
$TTL	604800
@	IN	SOA	joesmsse.com. root.joesmsse.com. (

frhn    IN      CNAME   ctrl1
worker1 IN      A       192.168.1.53
worker2 IN      A       192.168.1.54
worker3 IN      A       192.168.1.55
```

The mapping from ip to name.  Not 100% sure if this is necessary, but does allow a reverse nslookup as shown. 
```
joe@f6thw:~$ cat /etc/bind/db.192

# nslookup 192.168.1.50
50.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa	name = ns.joesmsse.com.

```

Useful commands when installing DNS: 

`vi /etc/bind/named.conf.local` - edit the bind9 configuration

`named-checkzone joesmsse.com /etc/bind/db.joesmsse.com` validate your zone file

`named-checkzone 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa /etc/bind/db.192` validate your reverse zone file. 

`sudo systemctl restart bind9.service` - restart the bind9 DNS server 

`systemd-resolve --status` show you what DNS server you are resolving against. 

`vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` edit your static ip, gateway and resolver

`dig haproxy.joesmsse.com` query the DNS server 


### Configuring HAProxy as a Load Balancer

I did [Step 1: Configuring HAProxy as a Load Balancer](https://www.inap.com/blog/deploying-kubernetes-on-bare-metal/) but the `nc -v $KBLB_ADDR 6443` says "... Connection refused". So, I've either mis-configured HAProxy, or I need to have the Kubernetes control plane running on the ctl1 and ctlr2 boxes before haproxy can serve any traffic to them. 

I re-installed HAProxy as per the above instructions and now 
the test of it succeeded: 
```
# nc -vz 192.168.1.50 6443
Connection to 192.168.1.50 6443 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

### Install Docker on Kubernetes Nodes

It seems the instructions on [Step 2: Install Docker and Related Packages on All Kubernetes Nodes](https://www.inap.com/blog/deploying-kubernetes-on-bare-metal/#anchor-2)
are out of date, so jumped to the [official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apt-transport-https  ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo docker run hello-world
```
Docker version 5:20.10.5~3-0~ubuntu-groovy got installed by the above. 
Repeated on all the control and worker nodes. 

SIDE NOTE: 
I noticed that sometimes instructions use `apt` and other times `apt-get`.  Curious, I found this [APT vs APT-GET: What's the Difference?](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/apt-vs-apt-get). Looks like `apt` is a newer improvement that combines apt-get with apt-cache, provides better output, and is faster.  So, try to use `apt` when available. It isn't completely backwards compatible. 

### Prepare Kubernetes on all nodes
Following [Step 3: Prepare Kubernetes on All Nodes](https://www.inap.com/blog/deploying-kubernetes-on-bare-metal/#anchor-3). 

But, found that the Kubernetes official docs also cover this [Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl)

```bash
sudo su -
apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl && apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
swapoff -a
sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
kubeadm version
cat > /etc/docker/daemon.json <<EOF
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart docker
```
Did this on all the control and worker nodes. 

### Install ETCD on the 1st Control node

[Step 4](https://www.inap.com/blog/deploying-kubernetes-on-bare-metal/#anchor-4)

```
cd /root

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.1.50:6443 --token scof1a.8yq25brso95dywm2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:e256108e1e0096867b6d5c8b99273deac4b0b30239a85b42d6cd5dde63776b56 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key f58dfe7489c3d0653eee6e3d96b861ca45f3d052b0533b373f9bbb521d83f08e

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.1.50:6443 --token scof1a.8yq25brso95dywm2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:e256108e1e0096867b6d5c8b99273deac4b0b30239a85b42d6cd5dde63776b56
```
