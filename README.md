MSSE SEIS776 Project

## Goal
Using the following links as reference, build a Kubernetes cluster on old hardware (Dell Latitude E5520 & E5540 Laptops). Documents such as these will be referenced: 

[Deploying Kubernetes on Bare Metal](https://www.inap.com/blog/deploying-kubernetes-on-bare-metal/)

[Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

## Project Notes
[This document](project-notes.md) contains my notes along the journey. 
They are not organized well yet, but will be useful for repeating the 
process and preparing a more cohesive presentation.
